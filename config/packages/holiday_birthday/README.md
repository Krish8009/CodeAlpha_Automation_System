<h4 align="left">Package Automations:</h4>
<h4 align="left">Reminders</h4>

This package contains a bunch of countdown sensors for any key dates I wish to keep track of. I use the state of these sensors to send myself timely reminders to buy presents or prepare for trips etc.

<h4 align="left">Announcements</h4>

On the day of a key event a TTS message will be played with the relevant content.

<h4 align="left">Future Enhancements</h4>

I aim to have automations specific to certain dates be driven by these sensors state, for example Halloween would enable a Boolean which would allow Node-RED Flows to change lighting colours and play spooky noises through the home audio system.
