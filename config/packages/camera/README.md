<h1 align="center">Camera Package</h1>
<p align="center">Be sure to :star: my repo!</p>
<hr *** </hr>

This package enables my TP-Link and Xiaomi IP Cameras for use with Home Assistant. Both of these cameras utilise the standard camera components however there needs to be separate camera server running in order to integrate the [Xiaomi Miija Camera](https://www.banggood.com/Original-Xiaomi-Mijia-Smart-AI-IP-Camera-Smart-Home-130-1080P-HD-Intelligent-Security-WIFI-IP-Camer-p-1326652.html?rmmds=buy&cur_warehouse=CN).

<h4 align="left">To be added</h4>
<p>I need to reinstall my HIKVision Camera after they finish the renovations to the front area, I will add in automations for image capture upon motion as well as the facial recognition stuff I have been working on with MachineBox. I also miss the automation for when someone rings the door bell it not only pauses my TV (still working) but passes the captured image onto my Kodi for viewing on the TV. Next step will be to get a smart lock to enable an actionable request on the screen to unlock the door if person is known.</br>
