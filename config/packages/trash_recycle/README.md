<h1 align="center">Trash Recycle Package</h1>
<p align="center">Be sure to :star: my repo!</p>
<hr *** </hr>
<p align="center">This package is designed to remind you to take out the bins but more importantly remind if it is also a recycle bin week as their pickups are normally every other week. This package was originally created by skalavala and has been modified to fit my purpose. I now use a Bluetooth Beacon to track whether my bin is in or out on the curb fully automated bin notifications just need to make a robot to take it to the curb for me :)</p>
