This package enables me to reference the time and date sensors generated in automations and template sensors.

Standard Home Assistant Components

Sensor - [Time_Date](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/sensor.time_date/)

Sensor - [Workday](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/binary_sensor.workday/)

Sensor - [WorldClock](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/sensor.worldclock/)

<h4 align="left">Package Automations:</h4>

Whilst there are no physical automations within this package these components are used extensively with any sensors that I use the time or date components. 
For example I track how many days it is until family members birthdays :birthday:, track when it is my trash collection day and which week for my receycle collection :recycle:.
I use the time as the trigger for alot of my lighting automations within Node-RED ::watch:.
