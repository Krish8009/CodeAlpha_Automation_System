<p align="center">Be sure to :star: my repo!</p>
<hr *** </hr>
<p align="center">This package monitors currency and some history stats around TV time and work/life balance and will be the package for any sensors that don't really fall into any other package. This is also now the package to track my packages :+1:</p>

<h4 align="left">TV Screen Time for Kids</h4>

I am very concious of the link between too much screen time and my kids behavours so I try to limit their screen time to no more then 2hrs a day. 
When they exceed this time the a script will run changing the TV to parental mode and switching off, and a TTS message will be played telling them to choose another activity. 
If they try to turn the TV back on once the time limit has been exceeded it will ask for the parental pin code before they can do anything.

<h4 align="left">Currency Alerts</h4>

I like to be alerted if currency shifts below/above certain thresholds as alot of my business is based in USD & GBP.
